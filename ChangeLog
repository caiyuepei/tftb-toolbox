  mode that plots Psi(Delta). Remove pointless 'xrange'
  argument.

  on constrained Levenberg-Marquardt optimization; easier to use for
  some applications, and it is good to have more than one nonlinear
  optimization algorithm. The new function also enables the use of 
  function objectives, which, e.g., would be needed for the design
  of dichroic mirrors.

- version 34
- fixed bugs in general purpose merit functions 'tf_rmin.m' 
  and'tf_tmin.m'. Averaging over angles had been done wrong.

  L. Martinu, "OpenFilters: open-source software for the design,
  optimization, and synthesis of optical filters", Appl. Opt. 47,

  matrix for each layer and returns the stack of matrices.
